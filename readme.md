##Visualizing Homicides in Oakland

This is a demo application that uses [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com/), [Torque](https://github.com/CartoDB/torque) and crime report data from the City of Oakland.

It was originally built at a [Code for Philly](http://codeforphilly.org/) civic application workshop by [Mark Headd](http://twitter.com/mheadd) and redeployed for Oakland by [Spike](http://twitter.com/spjika).

The visualization displays crime incidents categorized as homicides from January 1, 1995 through December 31, 2012 (18 years totalling 3,194 homicides).

##The Data

These data were compiled from the historical homicide database maintained by Urban Strategies Council for the years 1995 through 2002, along with homicide data maintained in the Oakland crime database from 2003 through 2011. The 2012 data was obtained form the City of Oakland's [public release](https://data.oaklandnet.com) for an [OpenOakland](http://twitter.com/openoakland) project.

There is no such thing as perfect crime data. Some crimes are missing, some are latter reclassified as not homicides, some are upgraded. Data are the most complete available but gaps are present and individual crimes will not appear because of this.
